“Linguistic relativity” is the idea that people think differently in different languages or cultures.

Some untranslatable terms are merely quirky reflections of a culture, but others point to more profound differences in thought. I was interested in exploring this concept, and as a side project decided to create a wiki to gather all of them in one place.

I designed and built the website in React, interviewed native speakers to help write the initial content, and illustrated some of the terms. People can also submit and edit the terms. There’s currently 120+ words in there and growing.
