Booli is a game for Korean learners. The idea occurred when a Chinese-speaking friend told to me how easy it was for him to pick up Korean vocabulary because of the roots in Chinese characters. I struggled with memorizing words, and saw an opportunity to provide the same root for English-speakers.

Booli (뿌리) means root. Around 70% of all Korean words inherit syllables from Chinese characters. Booli helps to learn these characters in a fun way, making vocabulary easier to remember and recognize. Once you learn one common syllable, you can guess many words.
