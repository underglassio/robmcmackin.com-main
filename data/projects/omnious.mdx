Omnious is a Korean startup that provides e-commerce fashion companies with machine vision technology.

I joined as one of the first 5 employees. We started out building a consumer app to shop through photos, then pivoted to providing this function as a B2B API to e-commerce companies. I designed everything along the way; pitch decks, back-end AI training dashboards, mobile apps and, of course, business cards.
